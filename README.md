# Remote Library Based on RPC

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides an **implementation of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library** in **Go**. The library enables the creation and management of a **TCP-based RPC server**, dynamically invoking methods on a service interface using **reflection**. The communication between the **client and server** is efficiently handled using **Go's encoding/gob package** for binary serialization and deserialization.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **TCP-based RPC Server**: Manages client-server communication over TCP.
- **Dynamic Method Invocation**: Uses **reflection** to call methods dynamically.
- **Binary Encoding & Decoding**: Utilizes **gob** for efficient data serialization.
- **Graceful Client Connection Handling**: Ensures smooth connection management.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles multiple client requests concurrently.
- **Concurrency Management**: Implements Go routines for efficient parallel execution.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/akhilk2802/remote-rpc-library.git
cd remote-rpc-library
```

### **2️⃣ Build and Run the Server**
```sh
go run server.go
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Client**
```sh
go run client.go
```

---

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Server starts a TCP listener** and waits for incoming client connections.
2. **Clients send RPC requests**, specifying the method to invoke.
3. **The server decodes requests** and dynamically invokes the requested method using **reflection**.
4. **The result is encoded using gob** and sent back to the client.
5. **The client receives the response** and decodes it for further processing.

## 📄 Future Enhancements
- **Support for JSON-based encoding** for wider compatibility.
- **Authentication & Security mechanisms** to ensure secure communication.
- **Load balancing & fault tolerance** for distributed RPC calls.
- **Streaming support** for handling large payloads efficiently.
